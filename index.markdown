I’m an immigrant in London with a love for good food, modern art galleries and filter coffee. Currently, working as software developer at [Soho House](https://www.sohohouse.com).

In my spare time, I like to read and write about circular economy, surveillance capitalism and human rights, I also [travel](https://www.javi.me.uk/categories/travels/), love to admire the grey-blue seascapes and the low light of the British coastline, cook and eat great food, learn about coffee and [listen to good music](https://bandcamp.com/donpotat).
