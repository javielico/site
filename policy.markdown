## I don’t track you

When you visit this website, I don’t track you. That means that you will not find any analytics, article limits or cookies on my site. You also won’t find any third-party scripts, content delivery networks or third-party fonts. I won’t let anyone else track you either.

## Sustainability
I'm not perfect, but it is something that I take very seriously. I have a range of environmental, social and financial strategies to help reduce negative impact and give something positive back to the world. These include:

* This site runs using green energy and energy efficient hardware 💚
* I only buying products that I need, re-use by using second hand products where available and selling our unwanted items, and try to recycle or compost as much waste as possible.
* Use low energy appliances wherever available such as low power single board computers.
* Consume renewal green energy supplied by [Bulb](https://bulb.co.uk).
* Support organisations that contribute and give back such as [Webarchitects Coop](https://www.webarchitects.coop) and [GreenNet](https://www.greennet.org.uk).
* Try to avoid using physical stationery and printing documents wherever possible, after all, we live in the digital age.
