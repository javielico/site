Here's a few things I'm doing as we speak:

* Thinking about what to do when we get ouf of quarantine, which restaurants to go, what food to eat, which sea side trip we're going to make...
* Day dreaming that quarantine will be over soon and I'll be able to go to work next week?
* Working on learning more SQL for my day to day work.
* Helping [Migrateful](https://www.migrateful.org) to live stream cooking classes.
* Going out for the authorised goverment walk hour during this lovely weather.
* Brewing all the coffee from [Origin](https://origincoffee.co.uk) to see which one I like the most.
