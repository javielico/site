## Doing/Thinking

* Thinking about Anna's birthday which is just a stone away.
* Daydreaming about having lunch at [Teteria Almedina](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187429-d3749939-Reviews-Teteria_Almedina-Almeria_Province_of_Almeria_Andalucia.html) which sadly we're not going to get to go this year.
* Using my extra day to sharpen my dev skills.
* Brewing all the coffee from [Carnival](https://www.carnivalcoffee.co.uk).

## What podcasts am I currently listening to?
* Mostly [This American Life](https://overcast.fm/itunes201671138/this-american-life) as usual.
* I've set [Today in Focus](https://overcast.fm/itunes1440133626/today-in-focus) on pause now to avoid news overload.
