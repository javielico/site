## Doing/Thinking

* Feeling very happy that we're moving to a home with more space.
* Hoping our plans to visit Andalucia this year will go as expected and we get a good rest and to see family.
* What coffee will [Curve Roasters](https://www.curveroasters.co.uk) ship next?
* Will I be able to manage anxiety and stress better?
